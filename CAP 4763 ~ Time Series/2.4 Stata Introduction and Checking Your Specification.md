**clear** -> clears everything

**set more** *off* -> doesn't pause after every command

**cd** "path" -> changes the directory

**log** *using* "file name" -> creates a log file with that name

**import** *delimited* "path" -> imports comma delimited files (csv, tsv, whatever)

**/\*** block comment ***/
******* single line comment

**scatter** *y-var x-var* -> creates a scatterplot with the x and y vars specified

**regress** *y-var x-var* -> creates a simple linear regression with the x and y vars specified

**STOP** -> isn't a command but will stop the do file because it will throw and error and stop

**regress** *y-var x-var,* **robust** -> ["Robust regression is an alternative to least squares regression when data is contaminated with outliers or influential observations and it can also be used for the purpose of detecting influential observations." (Links to an external site.)](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/dae/robust-regression/)

**regress** *y-var* **c.***x-var***##i.***x-var2*, **robust** -> same thing as before. c. = continuous variable, i. = indicator/dummy variable, ## = complete interaction between the x variables

**testparm** **i.***y-var* **i.***y-var***#c.***x-var* <- test parameters associated with y-var and y-var that's interacted with x-var

1. Is there a difference between # and ##?
2. Does it have to be y-var y-var or can it be y-var any-var?

**gen** *newName* = stuff -> creates a new variable called newName using anything put after the =

**corr** *var1 var2* -> Find the correlation between the variables

**vif** -> when run after **corr** it gives the variance inflation factor

**predict** *var* <- predicts var

**predict** *var*, **residuals** <- plots against residuals

**reg** -> same as **regress**

**log** close -> closes the log

**translate** *log_file_name* *new_pdf_name*
