â€‹	The ARDL model is much more "linear" than the AR model. While they both have the same general model, it looks like the AR model drew much more from the peak in 2019 than the ARDL did. I think this is because the AR model is only using nonfarm data so it's much more likely to replicate itself while the ARDL which uses more than one variable.
