## Case Study

31. Which of the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, discussed in the chapter, do you see in Julie Rice and Elizabeth Cutler? To what degree do you think these characteristics have contributed to Soul- Cycle’s success?
- SoulCycle has a very deep **product and customer focus** where they focus on the customer experience so that customers feel they are getting good value for their money. While they were not allowed to place a sign on their original building, they showed **tenacity despite failure** and went door to door and tried to spread their business through word of mouth. The clearly had good **execution intelligence** because their business took off.
32. How does SoulCycle’s basic offering, its 45 minute spinning classes, “add value” to the lives of its customers?
    - The basic class adds value to the lives of its customers through a high intensity workout with meditative elements. This allows customers to exercise which is known to be good for physical and mental health while also being in a *relatively* stress free environment which is also good for mental health.
33. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is high), rate SoulCycle on execution intelligence. Make a list of at least five things that you think SoulCycle did particularly well in this area. Justify your numerical ranking.
    1. **Starting in a city.** By starting in a city, you don't need to cater your market as much because there are more people and therefore more people who will be willing to try what you have to offer.
    2. **Full-time instructors.** Consistency is key. By employing full-time instructors, SoulCycle creates a personal connection with people. SoulCycle can then exploit this connection because people will feel they owe it to themselves *and* their instructor to show up.
    3. **No clocks.** A lot of people just watch the clock while exercising and wait for it to end. No clocks to watch means they have to get into the workout and power through the entire session.
    4. **The music.** If each instructor chooses their own music, then patrons can choose an instructor that matches their personality and music tastes better and so they'll be more inclined to go than if they didn't like the music.
    5. **The atmosphere.** Scented candles don't seem like a good idea in a spot where people will be hot from working out and breathing heavily.
34. Talk about the challenge that Peleton poses to Soul-Cycle. If you were asked to advise SoulCycle on how to respond to the Peleton threat, what would you tell the company to do?
    - I don't really know much about Peloton to have an opinion or be able to offer advice. Some people work out at home and some people work out at a gym. I don't think this is an issue for SoulCycle because of the experience they offer that Peloton doesn't.
