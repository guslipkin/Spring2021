2. Explain the importance of market segmentation. What are several ways markets can be segmented?
   - "Market segmentation is important because a new firm typically has only enough resources to target one market segment, at least initially.2 Mar- kets can be segmented in many ways, such as by geography (city, state, coun- try), demographic variables (age, gender, family size, income), psychographic variables (personality, lifestyle, values), behavioral variables (benefits sought, product usage rates, brand loyalty), and product type (varies by product). For example, the computer industry can be segmented by product type (i.e., hand- held computers, tablet computers, laptops, PCs, work stations, minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers) or customers served (i.e., individuals, busi- nesses, schools, and government)."

7. What is a brand? Provide an example of a brand that you buy frequently and describe the mental image that pops into your mind when you hear or see the brand’s name.
   - "A **brand** is the set of attributes—positive or negative—that people associate with a company. " One of my favorite brands is REI Co-op. They're an outdoors company so whenever I think of them I think of their stores, website, or various outdoor activities.
8. What is the purpose of brand management?
   - "Some companies monitor the integrity of their brands through **brand management**, which is a program used to protect the image and value of an organization’s brand in consumers’ minds.

9. What is meant by creating “buzz” for a company? Provide an example of a firm that has created effective buzz for its product or service.
   - "Creating **buzz** means creating awareness and a sense of anticipation about a company and its offerings.10 This process can start during feasibility analysis, when a company shows its concept statement or product prototype to prospective buyers or industry experts."

12. Describe the difference between a core product and an actual product.
    - "As the firm prepares to sell its product, an important distinction should be made between the core product and the actual product. While the core product may be a CD that contains a tax preparation program, the actual product, which is what the customer buys, may have as many as five characteristics: a quality level, features, design, a brand name, and packaging.16 For example, TurboTax is an actual product. Its name, features, warranty, ability to upgrade, packag- ing, and other attributes have all been carefully combined to deliver the benefits of the product: helping people prepare their federal and state tax returns while receiving the largest refund possible. "
13. How can a firm obtain a unique market position?

Determining which position in a market to occupy and in which to compete is a strategic call on the part of a company based on its mission, its overall approach to the marketplace, and its competitive landscape."
14. Contrast cost-based pricing and value-based pricing.

15. What is meant by the phrase “price-quality attribution”? How does an understanding of this phrase help an entrepreneur know how to price a product?
    - "This approach can win a sale but generates little profit. In addition, most consum- ers make a **price-quality attribution** when looking at the price of a product. This means that consumers naturally assume that the higher-priced product is also the better-quality product.20 If a firm charges a low price for its products, it sends a signal to its customers that the product is low quality regardless of whether it really is."

20. What is the purpose of having an organized sales process?

It doesn’t matter whether a firm is selling directly to customers or through intermediaries; it still has a process through which it makes sales. If it’s selling through an intermediary, like a distributor, it has to convince the distributor to carry its products and has to offer the distributor varying levels of support."
