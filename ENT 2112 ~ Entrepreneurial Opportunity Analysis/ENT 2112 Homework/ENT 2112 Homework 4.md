20. Who are “freelancers” and why are these individuals potentially attractive as partners for an entrepreneurial venture?
    - "A freelancer is an independent contractor who has skills in a certain area, such as website design, search engine optimization (SEO), or marketing. Start-ups hire freelancers for two reasons. First, they fill gaps that companies have in their expertise. For example, a business may need to develop a social media strategy, but lack capabilities in that area. There are freelancers who are social media specialists, who can quickly and effectively help a business design a social media strategy. Second, freelancers can be hired on an “as needed” basis, so they are typically cheaper than hiring a part-time employee. In addition, if a business hires a freelancer for a project and it doesn’t work out, a decision can be made to not hire the same person again. It is more difficult to separate from a part-time or full-time employee."

## Case 4.1

34. How does Etsy create, deliver, and capture value for its shareholders?
    - "Etsy has three revenue streams. The first is the 20 cent listing fee for each item listed on the site. While 20 cents doesn’t sound like much, there are more than 40 million unique listings on the site. Second, Etsy charges a 3.5 percent commission on each item sold. Third, the company earns money from seller services such as its advertising platform, payment processing, and website hosting (for sellers who sell products via their own website in addition to their Etsy store). This mix of revenue streams makes sense given Etsy’s core strategy and its resources. The larger and more engaged a community it builds, the more revenue it will earn from listing fees and commissions."
35. Is Etsy’s business model a standard or a disruptive business model? Explain your answer.
    - Etsy has a standard business model in the internet age. They are simply another marketplace for goods such as eBay or Amazon with the note that they are focused on handmade/craft items.
36. How is Etsy’s business model different from eBay’s business model for the makers of handmade goods?
    - Etsy exclusively sells craft items and does not have an auction format while on eBay you can sell anything and there can be an auction format.
37. In your judgment, what is the most serious challenge facing Etsy? To what extent does the challenge threaten Etsy’s business model? How should Etsy confront the challenge?
    - I think the biggest challenge facing Etsy is the sellers selling cheap crap that breaks or isn't what was promised. It is difficult for Etsy to prevent this because they have no control over the sellers and if they punish the sellers, other sellers will leave or people will stop buying from Etsy. Etsy cannot do anything to combat this besides only ban sellers when absolutely necessary.
