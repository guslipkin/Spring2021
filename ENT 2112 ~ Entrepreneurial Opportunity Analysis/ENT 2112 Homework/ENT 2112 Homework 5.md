3. "A **mature industry** is an industry that is experiencing slow or no increase in demand, has numerous repeat (rather than new) customers, and has limited product innovation. Occasionally, entrepreneurs introduce new product inno- vations to mature industries, surprising incumbents who thought nothing new was possible in their industries."
4. "A **declining industry** is an industry or a part of an industry that is experiencing a reduction in demand."

By studying the restaurant industry, Panera found that some con- sumers have tired of fast food but don’t always have the time to eat at a sit-down restaurant. To fill the gap, Panera helped to pioneer a new category called “fast casual,” which combines relatively fast service with high-quality food. Panera has been very successful in occupying this unique position in the restaurant industry."

> 15. What are the characteristics of a fragmented industry and why are these important for entrepreneurs?

- "A **fragmented industry** is one that is characterized by a large number of firms of approximately equal size." These are important for entrepreneurs because they provide a vector to market dominance through establishing industry standards that may not exist already.
