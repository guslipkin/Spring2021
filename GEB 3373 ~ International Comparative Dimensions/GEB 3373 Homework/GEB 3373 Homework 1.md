1. What is international business? How does it differ from domestic business?
	
	- International business is any business conducted between parties in more than one country. This could be importing and exporting goods or expanding the firm's business to a new, overseas market.
	- International business differs from domestic business in that in international business, the parties may use different currencies, have different laws regarding business practices, and have different work cultures.
2. Why is it important for you to study international business? 
	
	- The book states that although there are many reasons to study international business, they all converge to one major, overarching reason, that "international business is critical to career success in the twenty-first century."
	
	  Studying international business is not particularly relevant to my career goals because I want to go into public transportation management. However, just because it isn't super relevant doesn't mean it isn't relevant. Recently, the MBTA began receiving orders of new subway cars from a company in China. Without international business, that deal would never have happened. Outside of my career, I think it is important that in a global economy people understand how international business is conducted and how it affects economies and politics from the local to global scale.
