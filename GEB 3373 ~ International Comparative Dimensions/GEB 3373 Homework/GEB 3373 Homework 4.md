### Chapter 4

1. What is culture?
   - "Collection of values, beliefs, behaviors, customs, and attitudes that distinguish and define a society."

1. What are the primary characteristics of culture?
   - The primary characteristics of culture is that it reflects a learned behavior from those around you suck as talking with your hands if you're Italian, the elements of the culture are related, the culture is adaptive, and that the culture is shared "by members of the society and indeed defines the membership in the society".
     In list form:
     1. Culture reflects *learned behavior*
     2. The elements of culture are *interrelated*
     3. Culture is *adaptive*
     4. Culture is *shared*
2. Describe the difference between high-context and low-context cultures.
   - **Low-context culture**: "Culture in which the words being spoken explicitly convey the speaker’s message to the listener."
   - **High-context culture**: "Culture in which the context in which a discussion is held is equally as important as the actual words that are spoken in conveying the speaker’s message to the listener."
   - "Anglo-Saxon countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and Germanic countries are good examples of low-context cultures. In a **high-context culture** , the context in which a conversation occurs is just as important as the words that are actually spoken, and cultural clues are important in understanding what is being communicated. Examples are Arab countries and Japan."
     - When I took Mandarin in high school, I thought it was really cool how they don't have verb tenses but use context clues in the sentences or structure their sentences differently to give context to the action. For example, "I went running this morning" becomes "I run this morning" and if the morning already passed, then you know it's a past tense verb.
3. What are cultural clusters?
   - A culture cluster is a region that shares many similar but different cultures such as Chinese and Japanese culture or American and Canadian culture.
4. What are individualism and collectivism? How do they differ?

   - **Individualism**: "The cultural belief that the person comes first."

6. What is power orientation?
   - **Power orientation**: "Cultural beliefs about the appropriateness of power and authority in hierarchies such as business organizations."
   - *Power orientation* has two ends, *power tolerance*  and *power respect*. The former can be found in the USA, Israel, Ireland, or New Zealand while the latter can be found in France, Mexico, Brazil, and Singapore.
7. What is uncertainty orientation?
   - "Cultural beliefs about uncertainty and ambiguity."
   - *Uncertainty orientation* has two ends, *uncertainty acceptance* and *uncertainty avoidance*. The former is all about using uncertainty and opportunities to move upwards while the second recognizes uncertainty and change as a threat.
8. What are aggressive and passive goal behaviors? How do they differ?
   - **Aggressive goal behavior**: "Behavior based on the cultural belief that material possessions, money, and assertiveness underlie motivation and reflect the goals that a person should pursue."
   - **Passive goal behavior**: "Behavior based on the cultural belief that social relationships, quality of life, and concern for others are the basis of motivation and reflect the goals that a person should pursue."
   - *Aggressive goal behavior* is more material goal oriented and keeps work and home life entirely separate but they are both equally important. *Passive goal behavior* places higher value on 
9. What is the self-reference criterion?
   - **Self-reference criterion**: "The unconscious use of one’s own culture to help assess new surroundings."

1. What are ethics?

   - **Ethics**: "An individual’s beliefs about whether a decision, behavior, or action is right or wrong."
   - I don't know if you've ever seen the show *The Good Place*, but it's a wonderful show from the creator of *The Office* and *Parks and Rec* and focuses on ethics and their application. It's one of my favorite shows and I highly recommend it.

2. Distinguish between ethical and unethical behavior.

   - **Ethical behavior** is behavior that "conforms to generally accepted social norms". **Unethical behavior** is exactly the opposite in that it is behavior that "does not conform to generally accepted social norms."

3. What role does culture play in the formation of ethics? 

   - Because ethics are based in the accepted social norms, and social norms are created by culture, it would follow that culture plays a role in the formation of ethics.

4. How do organizations attempt to manage ethical behavior across borders?
