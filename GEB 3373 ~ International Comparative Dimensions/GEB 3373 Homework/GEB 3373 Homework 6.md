> 1. What determines the demand for any given currency in the foreign-exchange market?

- "Like the prices of other commodities, the price of foreign exchange—given a flexible exchange rate system—is set by demand and supply in the marketplace." For example, the demand curve for Japanese Yen is called the *derived demand* curve "because the demand for yen is derived from foreigners' desire to acquire Japanese goods, services, and assets."

> 2. What determines the supply of any given currency in the foreign-exchange market?

- Carrying the Japanese example from question 1: "Underlying the supply curve for yen is the desire by the Japanese to acquire foreign goods, services, and assets. To buy foreign products, the Japanese need to obtain foreign currencies, which they do by selling yen and using the proceeds to buy the foreign currencies. Selling yen has the effect of supplying yen to the foreign-exchange market."
