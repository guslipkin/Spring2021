> 2. Elements of the Hershey Company’s strategy have evolved in meaningful ways since the company’s founding as an American chocolate manufacturer in 1900. After reviewing the company’s history at **www.thehersheycompany.com/ about-hershey/our-story/hersheys-history.aspx** and the links at the company’s investor relations site (**https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/investors.html**), prepare a one- to two-page report that discusses how its strategy has evolved. Your report should also assess how well Hershey’s strategy passes the three tests of a winning strategy.
