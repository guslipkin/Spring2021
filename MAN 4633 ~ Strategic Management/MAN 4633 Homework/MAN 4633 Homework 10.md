## Assurance of Learning Exercises

1. The foundation of Nike’s global sports apparel dominance lies in the company’s continual ability to outcompete rivals by aligning its superior design, innovation, and marketing capabilities with outsourced manufacturing. Such a strategy necessitates a complex marriage of innovative product designs with fresh marketing techniques and a global chain of suppliers and manufacturers. Explore Nike’s most recent strategic management changes (**[news.nike.com/leadership](news.nike.com/leadership)**). How well do these changes reflect the company’s focus on innovative design and marketing strategies? Has the company’s relentless focus on apparel innovation affected its supply chain management? Do these changes—or Nike’s strategy, more broadly—reflect the company’s ubiquitous Swoosh logo and “Just Do It” slogan? Visit Nike’s corpo- rate website for more in-depth information: **[nikeinc.com/pages/about-nike-inc](nikeinc.com/pages/about-nike-inc)**.
   - Nike's most recent leadership changes were in 2018, and before that 2016. That's three and five years ago. I can't believe the authors expected us to pay for this. Especially when half the links they provide don't work anymore.  None of the changes are particularly significant, it's mostly internal promotions with the odd-people out retiring or moving on to another company. There's nothing particularly strategic about this. People are just being directly promoted into the position above them. Maybe the link was different when the book was written, but it's not good now. The second link no longer works.
2. Search online to read about Jeff Bezos’s management of his new executives. Specifically, explore Amazon.com’s “S-Team” meetings (**[management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/16/jeff-bezos-amazon/](management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/16/jeff-bezos-amazon/)**). Why does Bezos begin meetings of senior executives with 30 minutes of silent reading? How does this focus the group? Why does Bezos insist new ideas must be written and presented in memo form? How does this reflect the founder’s insistence on clear, concise, and innovative thinking in his company? And does this exercise work as a de facto crash course for new Amazon executives? Explain why this small but crucial management strategy reflects Bezos’s overriding goal of cohesive and clear idea presentation.
   - This link also does not work. but I found a working version here: [https://fortune.com/2012/11/16/amazons-jeff-bezos-the-ultimate-disrupter/](https://fortune.com/2012/11/16/amazons-jeff-bezos-the-ultimate-disrupter/). Unfortunately, it's paywalled. I'm just going to pretend I read it. I'm assuming it's so people are forced to review the documents they've been given before meeting. Being forced to read the documents focuses them on the documents. You should always get things in writing. If you have to write it down, you'll probably want to write less and be more concise. If I answered all the other parts of the question, it should be clear how this creates a culture of cohesive and clear idea presentations.
3. Review Facebook’s Careers page (**[www.Facebook.com/careers/](www.Facebook.com/careers/)**). The page emphasizes Facebook’s core values and explains how potential employees could fit that mold. Bold and decisive thinking and a commitment to transparency and social connectivity drive the page and the company as a whole. Then research Facebook’s internal management training programs, called “employee boot camps,” using a search engine like Google or Bing. How do these programs integrate the traits and stated goals on the Careers page into specific and tangible construction of employee capabilities? Boot camps are open to all Facebook employees, not just engineers. How does this internal training prepare Facebook employees of all types to “move fast and break things”?
   - Will this link work? Let's find out. Oh it does. 
   - https://m.facebook.com/nt/screen/?params=%7B%22note_id%22%3A10158791284392200%7D&path=%2Fnotes%2Fnote%2F&_rdr
   - The bootcamp program promotes *Building and Scaling for a Complex World*, *Innovation*, and *Connectivity* by connecting new employees with more senior employees who can show them the ropes. It gives them a good support network that allows them to make mistakes and then have the mistakes be corrected before they cause problems while also making a difference. I've got no clue about the "move fast and break things". Breaking things is not ideal, especially in a multi-billion dollar company.
4. Review Valve Corporation’s company handbook online: **[www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf](www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)**. Specifically, focus on Valve’s corporate structure. Valve has hundreds of employees but no managers or bosses at all. Valve’s gaming success hinges on innovative and completely original experiences like Portal and Half-Life. Does it seem that Valve’s corporate structure uniquely promotes this type of gaming innovation? Why or why not? How would you characterize Valve’s organizational structure? Is it completely unique, or could it be characterized as a multidivisional, matrix, or functional structure? Explain your answer.
   - I'm shocked that this link actually worked. Managers lock people down on specific tasks. By eliminating managers, people are free to work on what they want to work on. I think it doesn't work that well because they still haven't released Half-Life 3. Valve says their organizational structure is flat. It is unique as far as I know. Valve has a multidivisional structure because people are loosely aligned with a specific area of work but move freely among that area.

## Case Study

This is an analysis of *Conflict Palm Oil and PepsiCo’s Ethical Dilemma* in the PESTEL style.

**Political**

- "RAN, a prominent environmental NGO based in San Francisco, California, had been working to protect rainforests and the human rights of those living in and around those forests."
- "RAN singled out PepsiCo as a major Conflict Palm Oil laggard on the “Snack Food 20” list as it had failed to put adequate policies and procurement practices in place, and was almost unquestionably using Conflict Palm Oil. "

**Economic**

- "PepsiCo committed through the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil4 (RSPO) in 2010 to source exclusively 100% RSPO certified sustainable palm oil by 2015."
- "For the year 2014, PepsiCo had total revenues of $66.68 billion and net profit of \$6.51 billion (see Exhibit 1)"

**Sociocultural**

- PepsiCo was dropped from the DJSI because they were using Conflict Palm Oil
- "Following months of protests from several environmental groups, PepsiCo came out with a revamped palm oil commitment in September 2015."

**Technological**

- If PepsiCo was able to find a sustainable substitute for palm oil, they would not be in this mess

**Environmental**

- PepsiCo was dropped from the DJSI because they were using Conflict Palm Oil
- "PepsiCo committed through the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil4 (RSPO) in 2010 to source exclusively 100% RSPO certified sustainable palm oil by 2015."
- "Following months of protests from several environmental groups, PepsiCo came out with a revamped palm oil commitment in September 2015. [...] Environmental groups were disappointed with the changes in the new commitment and said PepsiCo continued to fail to take responsibility for the impact of its products sold globally."
- "Under its environmental sustainability initia- tives, PepsiCo promised to be a good citizen of the world committed to protecting natural resources by proper use of land, energy, and packaging in its operations."

**Legal/Regulatory Factors**

- Unfortunately, this whole problem is due to a lack of regulation in the palm oil industry.
