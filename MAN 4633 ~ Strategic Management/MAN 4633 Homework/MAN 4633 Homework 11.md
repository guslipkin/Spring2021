4. Read some of the recent Six Sigma articles posted at **www.isixsigma.com**. Prepare a one-page report to your instructor detailing how Six Sigma is being used in two companies and what benefits the companies are reaping as a result. Further, discuss two to three criticisms of, or potential difficulties with, Six Sigma implementation.



[IMPROVED RESCUE TIME FROM A BOLLING MILL MACHINE](https://www.isixsigma.com/implementation/case-studies/improved-rescue-time-from-a-bolling-mill-machine/)

​	A bolling mill is used to mechanically smooth and process uniform sheets of rubber. Sometimes the machine catches people in it and not just rubber. After observing the bolling mill process and reviewing standardized safety procedures, the Six Sigma agent presented some new safety measures. These included marking "the mill machine with arrows indicating correct open direction," placing "rescue tools and supplies (including sledgehammer, flashlight, nylon and steel wedges, wrenches, pry bars, PPE, utility knife, first aid supplies and a sealed bloodborne pathogen kit) in a cart on wheels," and others.

[USAGE-BASED MODELS IMPROVE ODDS IN SOFTWARE TESTING](https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/software/usage-based-models-improve-odds-software-testing/)

​	The Six Sigma agent wanted to improve the software testing process because it is frequently long and complicated. They needed to "understand the scope of users, requirements and system behavior detail to be modeled," "identify the states and transitions that describe behavior of interest," "estimate transition probabilities or long-range likelihood," "Use the Model to Inform Test Case Sampling Plans." The Six Sigma agent used statistical properties to choose where the data analysis would be most effective.

​	It can be difficult to implement Six Sigma if you can't get good source data. It could also be difficult to implement the findings.
