## Assurance of Learning Exercises

1. Go to the company website for REI (**[www.rei.com](www.rei.com)**). Click on Stewardship at the bottom of the page, and then click on some of the tabs below to learn more about the company’s culture and values. What are the key features of its culture? Do features of REI’s culture influence the company’s ethical practices? If so, how?
   - There's a reason it's called stewardship. It's all about being an ecologically responsible human being. Using recycled materials, selling used gear that you don't want any more, using sustainable resources and energy, and supporting rentals for short-term product use. REI's culture is a reflection of their ethical practices. They are a "practice what you preach" company and if they're saying you should do something, they will do that thing too.
2. Based on what you learned about REI from answering the previous question, how do you think the company’s culture affects its ability to execute strategy and operate with excellence?
   - I've applied to work at REI on more than one occassion and been offered a position that I couldn't take due to timing issues. Their company culture is easy to believe in because most of it is easy to put into practice. In addition, most REI employees enjoy working there and if you enjoy working somewhere, you'll put more effort in at your job which includes executing the relevant strategies and allows them to operate with excellence.
3. Illustration Capsule 12.1 discusses Epic’s strategy-supportive corporate culture. What are the standout features of Epic’s corporate culture? How does Epic’s culture contribute to its winning best-in-class awards year after year? How does the company’s culture make Epic a good place to work?

   - Turns out this isn't Epic the gaming company. Honestly, some of their 10 commandments seem pretty toxic, especially three and four. However, their principles seem good. In addition, the Illustration Capsule does not have enough information on why these commandments and principles make Epic a good place to work. It seems like more of "happy employees make a good product."
4. If you were an executive at a company that had a pervasive yet problematic culture, what steps would you take to change it? Using Google Scholar or your university library’s access to EBSCO, LexisNexis, or other databases, search for recent articles in business publications on “culture change.” What role did the executives play in the culture change? How does this differ from what you would have done to change the culture?
   - Executives love to dictate a culture change and make a company "their own" but they never work on the ground floor where their culture is being implemented. Very frequently it does not mesh with the reality of working on the ground floor. Executives must practice what they preach and must have experience and continue to work on the ground floor on occassion so that they are staying in touch with the environments that their employees work in. If I am ever an executive, I will make sure I am staying in touch.
