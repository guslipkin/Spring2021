3. American Airlines’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan filed in 2012 involved the company reducing operating expenses by $2 billion while increasing revenues by \$1 billion. The company’s strategy to increase revenues included expanding the number of international flights and destinations and increasing daily depar- tures for its five largest markets by 20 percent. The company also intended to upgrade its fleet by spending \$2 billion to purchase new aircraft and refurbish the first-class cabins for planes not replaced. A final component of the restructuring plan included a merger with US Airways (completed in 2015) to create a global airline with more than 56,700 daily flights to 336 destinations in 56 countries. The merger was expected to produce cost savings from synergies of more than \$1 billion and result in a stronger airline capable of paying creditors and rewarding employees and shareholders. Explain why the strategic initiatives at various orga- nizational levels and functions require tight coordination to achieve the results desired by American Airlines.
