> 1. L’Oréal markets 32 brands of cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products in 130 countries. The company’s international strategy involves manufacturing these products in 40 plants located around the world. L’Oréal’s international strategy is discussed in its operations section of the company’s website (**www.loreal.com/careers/who-you-can-be/operations**) and in its press releases, annual reports, and presentations. Why has the company chosen to pursue a foreign subsidiary strategy? Are there strategic advantages to global sourcing and production in the cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products industry relative to an export strategy?

- L'Oreal has chosen to pursue a foreign subsidiary strategy in order to specialize to the needs of people in different countries. For example, the needs of people in Scandinavian countries is probably very different from those in Kenya or Nigeria. By operating locally in different countries, L'Oreal can be closer to the ground and trends in each country they operate in. In addition to being more in touch with their customers, the foreign subsidiary strategy allows them to optimize import and export costs by choosing which plant a country receives their product from.

> 2. Alliances, joint ventures, and mergers with foreign companies are widely used as a means of entering foreign markets. Such arrangements have many purposes, including learning about unfamiliar environments, and the opportunity to access the complementary resources and capabilities of a foreign partner. Illustration Capsule 7.1 provides an example of how Walgreens used a strategy of entering foreign markets via alliance, followed by a merger with the same entity. What was this entry strategy designed to achieve, and why would this make sense for a company like Walgreens?

- The alliance then merger strategy made sense for Walgreens because they were able to leverage the new alliance and both companies could benefit from each other's strengths. Boots was able to expand their product line into the US market in Walgreens stores and Walgreens was able to work with Boots' wholesale drug business to bring down costs. Once Walgreens saw that the alliance between the two was successful, they merged to further cut down on costs and integrate both businesses.

> 3. Assume you are in charge of developing the strategy for an international company selling products in some 50 different countries around the world. One of the issues you face is whether to employ a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy, or a transnational strategy.
>    a. If your company’s product is mobile phones, which of these strategies do you think it would make better strategic sense to employ? Why?
> 

- If my company's product is mobile phones, I would employ a *transnational* business strategy. Smartphone budgets and needs can vary around the world, but some countries may have similar needs that can be addressed simultaneously. A good example of these differences is how phones produced for different countries will have antennas for each country's designated frequencies or how some phones, such as Samsung's M series, is primarily marketed towards the Indian market while the Galaxy series is marketed to more wealthy nations such as the US and UK.

> ​		b. If your company's product is dry soup mixes and canned soups, would a multi-domestic strategy seem to be more advisable than a global strategy or a transnational strategy? Why or why not?

- I believe that a global strategy would be more advisable than a multi-domestic or transnational strategy. Dry mixes and canned goods are incredibly durable and can therefore be shipped across the globe without fear of spoilage. In addition, many of the same soups are enjoyed around the world. This means you don't have to create products that are specific to certain countries or regions, but rather can focus on high quality staple soups such as chicken noodle or lentil.

> ​		c. If your company's product is large home appliances such as washing machines, ranges, ovens, and refrigerators, would it seem to make more sense to pursue a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy, or a transnational strategy? Why?

- Large home appliances are expensive to design, produce, and ship. However, they are also relatively low volume products compared to mobile phones or canned soup. I'm not entirely sure what the best strategy would be. I think a global strategy would be best because the business would become more efficient and a lineup of appliances could be developed that address the wide variety of needs across the globe.

> 4. Using your university library’s subscription to LexisNexis, EBSCO, or a similar database, identify and discuss three key strategies that Volkswagen is using to compete in China.

- All strategies from https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/04/e-mobility_strategy.html#

1. Use China to produce more than half of battery electric vehicles by 2028
2. Improve the R&D department for the Volkswagen auto group in China
3. Partner with Star Charge, FAW, and JAC to inncrease the network of public electric vehicle charging in China

​	When I joined Robinhood in the fall of 2019, I was a bit disappointed that I was given a GoPro stock, even if it was free. Once a giant in mobile video and extreme sports video technology, GoPro has slowly lost its edge and almost failed when trying to launch a new line of video drones.

​	GoPro began as a startup after the founder, Nick Woodman, used a Kodak camera strapped to his wrist to capture his surfing and a friend of his told him there had to be a better way. Thus, the GoPro brand was born. In fall 2006, YouTube was propelled into the spotlight when it was purchased by Google. Just a few months later, GoPro launched their HERO3 camera with considerably better video quality than its predecessors and competitors. The combination of high quality video and YouTube's newfound popularity caused GoPro's sales to triple. In 2010, BestBuy began carrying GoPro products. GoPro finally went public in June of 2014 at a valuation of \$24 per share. While revenue continued to increase through 2016, revenue growth began to decrease. This led to the development of the GoPro Karma drone, GoPro's first major failure.

​	In the US in 2016, the drone market was already well established. Chinese brand DJI already had roughly 50% market share with Parrot, Protocol, Yuneec, and 3D Robotics filling in the rest. 2015 holiday sales were up 445% from the previous year. The drone market continued to get worse for new entrants when Apple and DJI entered into a deal for Apply to stock DJI drones in their stores and when Xiaomi, another Chinese giant, launched their competing drone called the Yi4k which undercut many companies on price.

​	In mid-2016, GoPro made its first mis-step. They announced and offered pre-orders for the GoPro Omni, a 360-degree video system which required six cameras to operate and cost \$4,999. At this point, Samsung had launched their Gear 360 camera which cost just \$349. While the video quality between the two may not have been equal, the Gear 360 was much more accessible.

​	Amid lacklust sales in mid-2016, GoPro pushed back the launch of their Karma drone to the holiday season. This gave established competitors more time to entrench their brands and make it harder for new entrants such as GoPro. GoPro ended 2016 with their gross revenue down by 50%, their operating income was down a whopping 645%, and their net income down by an even larger 742%.
