## Assurance of Learning Exercises

> 1. L’Oréal markets 32 brands of cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products in 130 countries. The company’s international strategy involves manufacturing these products in 40 plants located around the world. L’Oréal’s international strategy is discussed in its operations section of the company’s website (**www.loreal.com/careers/who-you-can-be/operations**) and in its press releases, annual reports, and presentations. Why has the company chosen to pursue a foreign subsidiary strategy? Are there strategic advantages to global sourcing and production in the cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products industry relative to an export strategy?



> 2. Alliances, joint ventures, and mergers with foreign companies are widely used as a means of entering foreign markets. Such arrangements have many purposes, including learning about unfamiliar environments, and the opportunity to access the complementary resources and capabilities of a foreign partner. Illustration Capsule 7.1 provides an example of how Walgreens used a strategy of entering foreign markets via alliance, followed by a merger with the same entity. What was this entry strategy designed to achieve, and why would this make sense for a com- pany like Walgreens?

> ​		a. If your company’s product is mobile phones, which of these strategies do you think it would make better strategic sense to employ? Why?



> ​		b. If your company's product is dry soup mixes and canned soups, would a multi-domestic strategy seem to be more advisable than a global strategy or a transnational strategy? Why or why not?



> ​		c. If your company's product is large home appliances such as washing machines, ranges, ovens, and refrigerators, would it seem to make more sense to pursue a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy, or a transnational strategy? Why?



> 4. Using your university library’s subscription to LexisNexis, EBSCO, or a similar database, identify and discuss three key strategies that Volkswagen is using to compete in China.
