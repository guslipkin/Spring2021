> 1. L’Oréal markets 32 brands of cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products in 130 countries. The company’s international strategy involves manufacturing these products in 40 plants located around the world. L’Oréal’s international strategy is discussed in its operations section of the company’s website (**www.loreal.com/careers/who-you-can-be/operations**) and in its press releases, annual reports, and presentations. Why has the company chosen to pursue a foreign subsidiary strategy? Are there strategic advantages to global sourcing and production in the cosmetics, fragrances, and hair care products industry relative to an export strategy?

- L'Oreal has chosen to pursue a foreign subsidiary strategy in order to specialize to the needs of people in different countries. For example, the needs of people in Scandinavian countries is probably very different from those in Kenya or Nigeria. By operating locally in different countries, L'Oreal can be closer to the ground and trends in each country they operate in. In addition to being more in touch with their customers, the foreign subsidiary strategy allows them to optimize import and export costs by choosing which plant a country receives their product from.

> 2. Alliances, joint ventures, and mergers with foreign companies are widely used as a means of entering foreign markets. Such arrangements have many purposes, including learning about unfamiliar environments, and the opportunity to access the complementary resources and capabilities of a foreign partner. Illustration Capsule 7.1 provides an example of how Walgreens used a strategy of entering foreign markets via alliance, followed by a merger with the same entity. What was this entry strategy designed to achieve, and why would this make sense for a company like Walgreens?

- The alliance then merger strategy made sense for Walgreens because they were able to leverage the new alliance and both companies could benefit from each other's strengths. Boots was able to expand their product line into the US market in Walgreens stores and Walgreens was able to work with Boots' wholesale drug business to bring down costs. Once Walgreens saw that the alliance between the two was successful, they merged to further cut down on costs and integrate both businesses.

> 3. Assume you are in charge of developing the strategy for an international company selling products in some 50 different countries around the world. One of the issues you face is whether to employ a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy, or a transnational strategy.
>    a. If your company’s product is mobile phones, which of these strategies do you think it would make better strategic sense to employ? Why?
> 

- If my company's product is mobile phones, I would employ a *transnational* business strategy. Smartphone budgets and needs can vary around the world, but some countries may have similar needs that can be addressed simultaneously. A good example of these differences is how phones produced for different countries will have antennas for each country's designated frequencies or how some phones, such as Samsung's M series, is primarily marketed towards the Indian market while the Galaxy series is marketed to more wealthy nations such as the US and UK.

> ​		b. If your company's product is dry soup mixes and canned soups, would a multi-domestic strategy seem to be more advisable than a global strategy or a transnational strategy? Why or why not?



> ​		c. If your company's product is large home appliances such as washing machines, ranges, ovens, and refrigerators, would it seem to make more sense to pursue a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy, or a transnational strategy? Why?



> 4. Using your university library’s subscription to LexisNexis, EBSCO, or a similar database, identify and discuss three key strategies that Volkswagen is using to compete in China.
