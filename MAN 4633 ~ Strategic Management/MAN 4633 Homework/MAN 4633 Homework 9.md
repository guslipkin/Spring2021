After reviewing the About Dell sec- tion of its website (**[www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/about-dell](www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/about-dell)**), prepare a list of 10 specific policies and programs that help the company achieve its vision of driving social and environmental change while still remaining innovative and profitable.

> 2. Prepare a one- to two-page analysis of a recent ethics scandal using your university library’s access to LexisNexis or other Internet resources. Your report should (1) discuss the conditions that gave rise to unethical business strategies and behavior and (2) provide an overview of the costs resulting from the company’s business ethics failure.

   - In late 2018 and early 2019, two Boeing 737 MAX planes had abrupt mass casualty events. People were quick to try and draw conclusions about why these planes were crashing and tried to switch their flights to other models of plane. Eventually, the investigations turned to the 737 MAX's flight control software which was used to prevent engine stalls. It eventually came to light that the software was rushed out, production was not monitored, and that tests were not adequately administered. In addition, pilots were not made aware of the new software or how to disable it with manual override. Subsequently, the planes were grounded for several years while investigations were done, corrections were made, and the planes were approved again by the FAA.
     When the new 737 MAX planes were launched, they were so similar to past generations of 737 that pilots were only tasked with training on a tablet-based course like Canvas or Google Classroom, instead of a fully-equipped simulator like they would be if they were coming to a new plane. Similarly to the pilots, because the plane was so similar, Boeing did not have to get the plane fully re-certified. On October 29, 2018 Lion Air 610 crashed into the Java Sea and killed everyone on board. On March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 302 crashed and killed everyone onboard.
     Ultimately, the failures and groundings cost several hundred people their lives. Any airlines that flew the plane lost money from having it grounded and re-tooled. Boeing lost a lot of public trust and a lot of money when all is said and done.

- Warby Parker makes sure that it is only buying from responsible producers and donates to nonprofits to help other people see. In addition, they let potential customers try on glasses at home before buying so that they can reduce waste from people buying glasses then deciding they don't like it. I think it's triple-bottom-line performance is great.

4. Go to **[www.google.com/green/](www.google.com/green/)** and read about the company’s latest initiatives surrounding sustainability. What are Google’s key policies and actions that help it reduce its environmental footprint? How does the company integrate the idea of creating a “better web that’s better for the environment” with its strategies for creating profit and value. How do these initiatives help build competitive advantage for Google?
   - Google's key environmental policy is to be carbon free by 2030. It is planning on doing this by heavily investing in reneweable energy and resources.
